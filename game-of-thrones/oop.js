3. Let's say you were a huge fan of Object Oriented Programming and the api
offered the option to get all the data you needed at once. What classes
would you make and what functions would they have?
(_TIP: You do not have to write out the implementation of the functions
  (but you can if it makes it easier to think it through)_)
(_TIP: If you are unsure between two decisions, then write a comment with the
  alternative you considered but decided against with arguments. There is again
  no one correct answer here, but we want to see you think in an OOP way_)
(_TIP: If you want the code highlighting, it is also fine to create a `.js` file
and then write down here what file to look at_)
